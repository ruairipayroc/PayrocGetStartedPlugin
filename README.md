# PayrocGetStartedPlugin

## Create plugin to help initialize project to use Payroc SDK. 

### Requirements
Maybe have it also do template or something to help create transactions and such?

My thoughts is a quick walkthrough that is either automated changes similar to fabric or Firebase that can do basic checks on implementation. Would like to see what requirements are and once we have a good understanding of what is possible we can make a decision on how to proceed.
